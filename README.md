# SLR_Real_Estate
I'll start with Simple Linear Regression (SLR), then explore more advanced regression techniques like Multiple, Polynomial, Lasso, and Ridge Regression to enhance the model. Finally, I'll apply Machine Learning Operations (ML Ops) techniques for efficient deployment and maintenance.

Currently Its Adjusted R2 Score is 0.64 & Cross-Validation score is 0.45, There are some strategies I've noted to be applied & check the score again else I'll apply other regression techniques.
